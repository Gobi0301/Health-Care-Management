# Health Care Management System

# üìÑ Project Overview
The Health Care Management System is a comprehensive application built using Java Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, RESTful API, and Docker. It aims to streamline the management of health care services, providing functionalities for patients, doctors, and administrators. The system ensures efficient handling of patient data, appointments, medical records, and other related information.

# üíª Technologies Used
Java Spring Boot: Backend framework for building robust and scalable applications.
Thymeleaf: Server-side Java template engine for dynamic HTML rendering.
RESTful API: Enables smooth communication between the frontend and backend using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Docker: Used for containerizing the application, ensuring easy deployment and scalability.
YAML Configuration: The Docker setup includes docker-compose.yml files for environment configuration and service orchestration.


# üõ†Ô∏è Project Features

# 1. User Management

Patient Registration and Login: New patients can register, and existing patients can log in to the system.
Doctor Management: Doctors can view their schedules, patient details, and medical records.
Admin Dashboard: Administrators can manage users, doctors, and view reports.

# 2. Appointment Scheduling

Patients can book, view, and cancel appointments with doctors based on availability.
Doctors can approve, reschedule, or cancel appointments.

# 3. Medical Records

The system maintains a complete medical history for each patient, including diagnosis, prescriptions, and treatment notes.
Patients can view their own records, while doctors have access to their patients' histories.

# 4. Search and Filter

Users can search for doctors by specialization, location, and availability.
The system supports filtering of records based on date, department, or doctor's name.

# 5. Responsive UI with Thymeleaf
The frontend is developed using Thymeleaf, making the UI dynamic and user-friendly.
Forms and templates are rendered on the server side, providing a seamless user experience.
# 6. RESTful API Integration
The backend exposes several RESTful APIs for handling data operations like user registration, appointment management, and medical record retrieval.
The APIs use standard HTTP methods:
GET: Fetch data (e.g., list of doctors, patient records).
POST: Create new entries (e.g., new user registration).
PUT: Update existing data (e.g., edit appointment details).
DELETE: Remove entries (e.g., delete a patient record).
# 7. Docker and YAML Configuration
The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run on different environments.
The docker-compose.yml file defines the services, including the Spring Boot application and the database, enabling seamless orchestration.
# üåê Project Workflow
* User Registration/Login: Users register and log in to access the application.
* Appointment Management: Patients can book appointments, and doctors can manage their schedules.
* Medical Record Access: Doctors can view and update patient records, while patients can view their own medical history.
* API Communication: The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs for data exchange.
* Deployment: The application is deployed using Docker containers for efficient and consistent environments.


# üöÄ Conclusion
The Health Care Management System is designed to improve the efficiency of health care services by automating appointment scheduling, medical record management, and user interactions. It leverages Spring Boot for backend logic, Thymeleaf for UI rendering, and Docker for deployment, making it a powerful and scalable solution for health care providers.
